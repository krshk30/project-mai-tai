# Schwab resting STOP_LIMIT goes out with `limit == stop`

**Author `claude-1`, 2026-09-21. Reviewer `codex-2`. Analysis + proposal — NO code in this PR.**
Board row it answers (09-19 handoff, moved `codex-2` → `claude-1` by the operator 09-21): *state the reject reason for each of
the 6 rejected; show where the Schwab adapter rounds stop and limit onto one tick; propose (no code yet) whether the limit
should be tick-adjusted upward like Webull's `raw_valid_wire_collapsed` path; re-run the n/N harm count.*

## Verdict

1. **It is not the Schwab adapter and not the wire — it is the OMS.** `_apply_v2_oco_bracket_entry`
   (`oms/service.py:11172`) rounds `stop_price` and `limit_price` **independently** with `_schwab_round` (`:214`,
   nearest cent above $1.00) at `:11271` and `:11273`. v2 sends stop 1.2166 / limit 1.2227; the OMS turns both into 1.22 before
   the adapter ever sees them. The handoff's "the Schwab wire rounds both" is wrong at that one word.
2. **It happens only between $1.00 and $2.00, and there it is one order in three.** v2's band is 0.5% (measured median 0.5000%,
   range 0.4919–0.5073). Half a percent is less than one cent below $2.00, so stop and limit can land on the same cent; at or
   below $1.00 Schwab takes 4 decimals and above $2.00 the band is a cent or more. **47 of 145** orders in the $1–$2 bucket
   collapsed; **0 of 406** outside it.
3. **0 of the 6 rejects were caused by it.** Five are *"Opening transactions for this security must be placed with a broker"*
   (Schwab-restricted names), one is *"The stop price must be above the current ask"* (late arrival). Same answers the
   non-collapsed orders get.
4. **Harm: none measured — and barely exercised.** Of the 41 accepted collapsed orders, 23 have captured tape; only **2** were
   ever triggered, and both filled. 21 never triggered (no chance of harm), 14 cancelled orders have no tape (UNMEASURED), and
   the other 4 fills have no tape but did fill. `0 of 2`, not `0 of 39`.
5. **But the mechanism is real and one step away.** In the same $1–$2 bucket, **4 of 12** non-collapsed fills executed ABOVE
   their stop — they used the band. A collapsed order has no band to use: it fills only if the ask is exactly at the stop
   (5 of 6 collapsed fills are exactly at the stop, 0 above). And QCLS 09-16 13:43 ET shows the miss itself on a ONE-cent band:
   stop 1.06 / limit 1.07, 897 prints at or above the stop, ask up to 1.23, never filled.
6. **Proposal (no code here):** after rounding, if `wire_limit <= wire_stop`, lift the limit one tick above the stop — the rule
   Webull's adapter already applies (`[WEBULL-BUY-STOP-LIMIT-TICK-ADJUSTED] … polarity=wire_limit_gt_wire_stop`). GIPR 09-18:
   Schwab got 1.22 / 1.22, Webull got 1.22 / 1.23 for the same signal.

## Population

`broker_orders` on `live:schwab_1m_v2`, `order_type='STOP_LIMIT'`, `side='buy'`, submitted 2026-09-01 → 2026-09-18 inclusive:
**551** orders. Intended prices = `trade_intents.payload.metadata`; wire prices = the first `broker_order_events` metadata
carrying `stop_price` (551 of 551 have it). **`limit == stop`: 47 of 551 (8.53%)** — cancelled 35, filled 6, rejected 6.
⚠ `codex-2`'s 09-19 figure was 45 of 532 (39 accepted / 6 rejected); mine runs one session later (09-18: 3 of 37 collapsed).
The 6 rejects are the same 6.

Schwab accepts a stop-limit whose limit equals its stop (41 accepted). Neither reject reason mentions the limit.

## Harm count — and the control that nearly voided it

Test: while the order rested, did the market reach the stop, and did the order then fail to fill? Bucket $1–$2 only (the only
place collapse occurs), accepted orders only (filled or cancelled): 41 collapsed, 56 not. Tape = `market_capture_trades` /
`market_capture_quotes`.

⛔ **My first two runs FAILED THEIR CONTROL and I nearly reported them.** An order that FILLED must have been triggered, so the
filled orders are the known-positive. Run 1 (prints ≥ stop, window `accepted → filled event`) saw the trigger in **1 of 18**
filled orders; run 2 (ask ≥ stop) in **0 of 5**. Two causes: (a) capture holds **no tape at all** for these symbols on
09-01…09-04 — 48 of the 97 orders; (b) Schwab stamps the fill at whole-second precision (`13:05:41.000`) and the triggering
prints land later INSIDE that second, so a window ending at the fill event cuts them off. With the fill second included the
control reads **5 of 5 by prints, 4 of 5 by ask**. ⇒ a "0 triggered-and-unfilled" is only a result if the filled orders light up first. I do not know how the
09-19 `0 of 39` windowed its tape or whether it covered 09-01…09-04; reviewer, please say — if it ended at the fill event or
leaned on this capture for those days, it has the same hole.

| $1–$2, accepted | orders | with tape | filled | triggered (print ≥ stop) | …and UNFILLED |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| collapsed (`limit == stop`) | 41 | 23 | 6 | 2 | **0** |
| not collapsed | 56 | 26 | 12 | 4 | **1** (QCLS 09-16 13:43:15→13:48:02, stop 1.06 / limit 1.07, 897 of 4,901 prints ≥ stop, max ask 1.23) |

Where the fills landed, $1–$2: collapsed n=6 — below stop 1, at stop 5, **above stop 0**; not collapsed n=12 — below 5, at 3,
**above 4**. The band is used by a third of the fills that have one.

## A second thing the same two lines do (not in the row — flagged, not proposed)

`_schwab_round` rounds the STOP to the nearest cent too: across all 551 the wire stop is **above** the intended ATR level in
264, **below** it in 246, equal in 41. A stop rounded DOWN triggers before the level the strategy computed (up to half a cent —
0.4% on a $1.20 name). Whether the buy-stop should ever sit below the ATR line is a strategy question for the operator, not a
rounding detail; I have not measured what it costs or earns.

## Proposal — for review, not built

In `_apply_v2_oco_bracket_entry`, after both values are rounded: if `limit <= stop`, set `limit = stop + one tick` (0.01 above
$1.00, 0.0001 at or below). Log one line when it fires, as Webull's adapter does.

- **Reach:** $1–$2 names only, ~8.5% of Schwab resting entries (47 of 551); nothing else changes by construction.
- **Cost:** the band on those orders becomes one cent = 0.50–1.00% instead of 0. The $1–$2 bucket already sends up to 0.962%
  on non-collapsed orders, so this introduces no band wider than ones live today.
- **What it does NOT fix:** QCLS-style gaps through a one-cent band, and the stop-rounded-down question above.
- **File:** `src/project_mai_tai/oms/service.py` — held by `claude-1` for sweep item 1, so it can ride in that work or as its
  own small PR; it needs a fixture from this table (GIPR 09-18: 1.2166 / 1.2227 → 1.22 / 1.23) and a control above $2.00 where
  nothing may change.

## What this cannot see

- 14 cancelled collapsed orders with no captured tape (09-01…09-04): whether any was triggered and missed is UNMEASURED.
- Whether Schwab triggers a buy stop on last trade or on the ask. Its reject text speaks of the ask; the control matched prints
  5 of 5 and ask 4 of 5. Both were run; they agree on the harm count.
- Fills that a band would have caught and a collapse lost leave no trace except "cancelled" — which is why the exercised
  denominator (2) matters more than the population (41).
