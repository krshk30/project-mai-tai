## 🚦 STATUS — v2 IS LIVE (Schwab real money) — running the CONFIRMED-WINDOW ruleset since 2026-07-10

> **2026-07-10:** v2 now trades the **confirmed-window** rules (wait-3 ATR-break entry · +2%/−5%/bar-close-flip exit)
> LIVE at **canary qty 2**. Single kill switch `CONFIRMED_WINDOW_ENABLED`; rollback = flag false + restart. See the
> **🆕 2026-07-10** OPEN ITEMS block below for the full deploy record + open tasks. The 2026-06-17 go-live context
> (below) still holds for account/routing/rollback fundamentals.

v2 went **live-credentialed** on **2026-06-17** as a **reasoned, operator-accepted risk** (profitability-after-spread
was/is still accumulating — see open items). Running config, ground-truthed from `/proc/<pid>/environ` + DB on deploy:

- **`broker_provider=schwab`, `account_name=live:schwab_1m_v2`**, real shared hash bound (the only `live:` Schwab key);
  `go_live_enabled=true`, `atr_only_mode=true` (P1/P2 disabled at two layers), qty 10, ATR fresh-flip qualifier on (age<5).
- **CYN is PROTECTED** — `MAI_TAI_PROTECTED_SYMBOLS=CYN` → `protected_symbol_set={CYN}` in the running config; the real
  account **holds 8000 sh CYN @ $2.57** (operator's manual position). 3-layer block + watchlist exclusion + #326. v2
  has never emitted/ordered/filled CYN (verified). `oms_managed_positions` CYN rows = 0 (bot does not manage it).
- **Rollback (tested):** `systemctl stop project-mai-tai-schwab-1m-v2.service` halts new entries instantly (OMS +
  market-data keep managing exits). Re-isolate to paper = `GO_LIVE_ENABLED=false` + `BROKER_PROVIDER=simulated` + restart.
  Env backup: `/etc/project-mai-tai/project-mai-tai.env.bak.pre-golive.20260617T003247Z`.

**What "live" has and hasn't proven yet:** the execution path is proven **to Schwab acceptance** (06-17: LNAI order
accepted by Schwab, working order, broker_order_id assigned). It is **NOT yet proven to a real FILL** — see open items.

## 🔴 OPEN ITEMS — DO NOT LOSE (future-you: read these)

**🆕 2026-07-10 (v2 CONFIRMED-WINDOW RULESET — DEPLOYED LIVE, canary qty 2):**
- **🟢 v2 now trades the CONFIRMED-WINDOW ruleset LIVE (real money, canary qty 2).** Operator ordered the rule change 07-08/09 ("don't wait 30 days; change the rules, keep the plumbing; real money, NOT shadow, qty small — watch daily"). **Replaces** v2's old ATR touch/flip entry + scale-ladder exit with: **ENTRY** = on an ATR BUY flip, wait 3 bars, enter on the first later bar whose HIGH breaks the max-high of those 3 bars (SELL flip before the break cancels); **EXIT** = full close at **+2% target** OR **−5% hard stop** OR a **bar-close-confirmed ATR flip** (bar CLOSES below the trail). Research script = `scratchpad/atr_wait3_oos.py` (`/home/trader/wt-atr-ab/`). [[project_mai_tai_v2_confirmed_window_ruleset]]
- **DEPLOYED 2026-07-10 ~00:07 ET** (attended, market closed, fleet flat 129/129 closed). PRs: **#408** entry (`_maybe_atr_emit`→`_cw_entry`) · **#409** OMS price exits (config-free `check_full_target`/`check_hard_stop_pct` + CW branch in `_evaluate_v2_managed_exit`) · **#411** bar-close flip **Route C** (strategy `_maybe_cw_flip_close` emits a `v2_cw_flip` stream event → OMS marks in-memory `_cw_flip_pending` → closes the managed row on next quote; precedence target>hard>flip) · **#413** CW exclusive with the on_quote hold-confirm touch (dual-entry bug caught in pre-flight) · **#412** first-session watch · **#407** stopping-rule doc. Deployed HEAD `b94ba7d`.
- **Live env** (ground-truthed from `/proc/<pid>/environ` on deploy): `CONFIRMED_WINDOW_ENABLED=true`, `HOLD_CONFIRM_ENABLED=false`, `ATR_FLIP_QUANTITY=2` (canary), `ATR_ONLY_MODE=true`, `OMS_V2_EXIT_MANAGEMENT_ENABLED=true`, account=live:schwab_1m_v2, go_live=true. Single kill switch = `CONFIRMED_WINDOW_ENABLED` (read by BOTH strategy entry + OMS exit → can't diverge). Env backup `/etc/project-mai-tai/project-mai-tai.env.bak.precw-*`. Post-restart verified: v2+oms active, 0 restarts, 0 v2 errors, flat. (Benign at restart: transient Webull 429 on ORB position-sync — ORB flat/closed, self-resyncs; NOT v2/CW.)
- **First-session watch ARMED**: `ops/health/v2_cw_first_session_watch.sh` (byte-offset reads; six markers: `[V2-CW] ENTER`, strategy flip-signal, `[OMS-V2-CW] flip pending armed`, `CW_TARGET`/`CW_HARD_STOP`/`CW_FLIP`) via cron `* 8-23 * * 1-5` → ntfy `mai-tai-preopen-28806a5a97b7` on the FIRST of each. **REMOVE the cron after the first session confirms all paths fire.**
- **⏳ OPEN TASKS (operator pinging next session):** (1) validate the **first live session** — confirm the first CW entry/exit fired correctly + report the first fills (watch for the ntfy pings); (2) **step qty 2→10** once the confirmed-only edge shows live (`ATR_FLIP_QUANTITY`); (3) run the **forward test** vs `docs/atr-confirmed-window-forward-test.md` (30 name-days; kill if median negative OR flip-exit avg worse than −5% OR win-rate below payoff-implied breakeven); (4) **remove the watch cron** after first session. **Two honesty caveats:** v2 fills are IDEALIZED (`reference_price`, no entry slippage) → live looks BETTER than the −1.28% diluted backtest (confirmed-only 07-09 was +1.68%); watch flip-exit slippage specifically. The live confirmed-only forward test IS the validation the backtest can't be. **Rollback** = `CONFIRMED_WINDOW_ENABLED=false` + restart (byte-identical off). **#404 untouched.**
- **Scanner-confirmed capture** (the confirmed-universe feed): DB capture live since 07-09 (#405/#406, `scanner_confirmed_events`); pre-market verify cron + JSONL backup. This is the durable record of what the momentum scanner actually confirms/drops per day. [[project_mai_tai_scanner_confirmed_capture]]

**🆕 2026-06-25 (today's threads):**
- **🟢 ORB OMS-quote-priced entry (Piece 1) — DEPLOYED LIVE (flag ON) 2026-06-25 14:22 ET; AWAITING OPEN VALIDATION.** Fixes the stale-entry cancel (06-25 AZI `BUY 5 @ 1.90` → `QUOTE_DRIFT_CANCEL`, 0 filled: the bot shipped its signal-time break-level limit, ~3.5s stale at the broker). Design **PR #382** + code **PR #383** (`docs/orb-oms-quote-priced-entry-design.md`) — both **merged on genuine green** (validate SUCCESS, auto-merged by the repo merge-on-green action, NOT admin-bypass; full unit suite 939 passed). When on: ORB omits `limit_price`/`reference_price` (fail-closed); OMS re-prices at placement from its live Polygon quote `limit=min(ask+1tick, break×(1+gap_cap))`, abandons on `MISSING_BOUND`/`NO_FRESH_QUOTE`/`ASK_PAST_GAP_CAP` (instrumented). **DEPLOYED (attended, operator GO): fleet verified flat (only protected CYN), env `MAI_TAI_ORB_OMS_QUOTE_PRICED_ENTRY_ENABLED=true` (backup `.bak.pre-piece1.20260625T182151Z`), live tree ff→`37ccdc5` (exactly the 3 Piece-1 src files), `git pull` + restart BOTH → orb PID 2825677 / oms PID 2825688, 0 tracebacks, flag confirmed in both `/proc`.** Done in-window (14:22 ET) but ORB's 09:30–10:00 window was CLOSED → no entry today; this pre-positions the flag. **⏳ VALIDATION = the 2026-06-26 open: watch `[OMS-ORB-QUOTE-PRICED]`→`[ORB-OPEN]` with `oms_quote_priced=true`, OR a clean `[OMS-ABANDON-INTENT] code=ASK_PAST_GAP_CAP|NO_FRESH_QUOTE`.** Rollback = flag false + restart both. ORB-only; v2 + stop path untouched. **Pieces 2 & 3 (per-venue Webull quote book) PARKED** — Webull market-data NOT entitled (probe: `MarketData.get_snapshot` → 401 "subscribe to stock quotes"); entry+stop run off Polygon NBBO while executing on Webull (accepted basis risk; first suspect if thin-name fills look off). [[project_mai_tai_orb]]
- **🔴 Schwab token DIED again 2026-06-25 (~07:38 ET) — refresh_token `invalid_grant` (weekly expiry).** v2 401-ed on every Schwab call (552×) until operator re-auth; recovery confirmed (v2 warming symbols by ~11:30 ET, FCUV ATR fired 12:53). **The dedicated refresher stays alive + retries but CANNOT fix a dead refresh_token — only human re-auth does** (then it self-heals; no restart needed this time, streamer reconnected). Recurs ~weekly; surfaced loudly via `[SCHWAB-TOKEN-REFRESHER-DEGRADED-PERSISTENT]`. [[project_mai_tai_context]]

**🆕 2026-06-24 (today's threads):**
- **✅ Webull real ORB account — GO-LIVE DONE 2026-06-24 night.** 2FA was a red herring (real cause = wrong account_id + host); adapter built (#364), `live:orb`→webull margin wired, qty-1 live plumbing test PASSED (fill→arm→flatten verified) **after fixing 4 go-live blockers (#374/#375/#376/#377, +#373 logging)**, ORB service STARTED (PID 2765863). **RESIDUAL OPEN:** (1) **restart-while-holding UNTESTED** — don't restart OMS while ORB holds; (2) ORB real-money profitability still to accumulate; (3) first real entry = 9:30–10:00 ET 2026-06-25 (watch `[HARD-STOP ARMED]` in oms.log). [[project_mai_tai_webull_fill_arm_verified]]
- **#366 snapshot-persist throttle — ATTENDED close-deploy + validate** (enable `snapshot_persist_throttle_secs`, re-arm the #350 py-spy capture at a 16:00 ET close, confirm snapshot gaps <50s). Then decide #350 **piece #2 (offload) / #3 (encode-once)** from the re-capture. **PRs #365 (design) / #366 (throttle)**.
- **strategy-engine restart drift** — box disk (`e76d8b5`, #362+#363) is AHEAD of the running strategy-engine (PID 2415361, not restarted). Next restart deploys #362's byte-identical leaf import — attend it.
- **ORB trail width** — regime-classifier rejected; default a FIXED trail (3% leading on 1 week, idealized fills). Confirm on more days / realistic fills before committing. Also reroute the backtest decider off `market_trade_ticks` onto validated `market_capture_trades`.
- **🆕 V2 ATR hold-confirm Path-B LEAK — DECISION PENDING (measured 2026-06-24, not yet built).** Hold-confirm IS live/enabled (N=20s/5bps), but **83% of actual entries (5/6 in the 06-23/24 era; 100% historically — re-confirmed 06-25: ALL 25 recent ATR entries are `ATR Flip B`, zero Path A) leak through the UNCONFIRMED bar-close fallback (Path B)**, and Path-B is net-negative (live −$4.89/32%win; backtests −$5.91 & −$18.78/~15%win) — i.e. the bar-close fallback undoes the hold-confirm edge. **Decide: (1) apply the 20s net_delta confirm to Path-B too, or (2) skip bar-close-only flips entirely** (backtest option 2 first — dropping Path-B may itself flip net positive). **FOLD-IN (06-25, operator): force FRESH-PROMOTION entries through hold-confirm (never Path B) — same fix.** A symbol's first 1–2 bars after a (re)promotion are the least-trustworthy flip: the scanner promotes AT the breakout (selection bias) so the entry coincides with the most volatile bar AND goes in unconfirmed (e.g. FCUV 06-25 12:53 entered Path B on the first bar after a 12:52 re-seed, +2% scalp). Requiring hold-confirm on Path B automatically gates these. Deeper: the ATR ENTRY EDGE (~15% win, buys faders that reverse) is the real weak link, NOT the watchlist — the change%<30 scanner-fade rule (#277) is net-PROTECTIVE for ATR, keep as-is. **Warmup phantom-flip RULED OUT (06-25 code + data + determinism test):** db-seed replays the 250 hydrated bars through `on_bar`→`_update_atr_state` (runs every bar before any gate; historical ts suppress the intent, not the ATR), so trail STATE is RECONSTRUCTED, not fresh-flip-by-construction; empirically FCUV had 11 promotions→1 entry (AZI 1 promotion→4 spread entries) = promotions don't manufacture flips. Seed-vs-continuous determinism test: trends + long-then-flat reconstruct EXACTLY; the only mismatch is **short-then-quiet >250 bars** (seed inits "long" and never re-flips → reads long when chart is short) — but it is **strictly conservative** (BUY-only entries → at worst a MISSED entry that self-heals on the next down-move; can NEVER manufacture a phantom BUY). Optional belt-and-suspenders: require ≥1 live ATR flip / N live bars since promotion before trusting state (low priority — the error direction is safe). [[project_mai_tai_v2_atr_validation]]

1. **RESTART-WHILE-HOLDING is UNTESTED.** The 06-17 mid-session restart recovery test (below) was run **FLAT**. We have
   **not** verified how v2 recovers a restart **while holding an open position** — i.e. position reconciliation across
   restart, exit-ladder continuity, and whether the held position's exit metadata/floor/stops survive. **Test this before
   relying on restart safety during a live trade.** (Recovery-while-flat = ~17s, proven; while-holding = unknown.)
2. **✅ RESOLVED (confirmed 2026-06-17) — CI `validate` is GREEN again and can gate.** The JSONB-on-SQLite harness
   incompatibility (`market_trade_ticks`/`market_quote_ticks.raw` → JSON variant) + stale assertions that made every
   push red are fixed on main. **Proof: PR #333's `validate` ran fully green** (unit + integration/replay + ruff, 1m24s)
   — a branch off main could not pass if the ~150 JSONB CompileErrors were still present. Merges no longer *need*
   `--admin` to bypass red CI (admin-merge stays available). Keep running the targeted test file + ruff locally anyway.
3. **First real ATR FILL still PENDING.** 06-17 fired 4 live qty-10 ATR orders (08:05–08:17 ET): **NIVF/YMAT/EHGO REJECTED**
   by Schwab — *"Opening transactions for this security must be placed with a broker. Contact us"*; **LNAI** Schwab-**ACCEPTED**
   then **OUR-side CANCELLED** (`abandon_reason_code=SETUP_INVALID` — ATR setup reverted next bar). **All $0 filled, no
   position.** So the headline behavioral proof (real fill @ qty10 → managed exit) awaits a flip on an **API-eligible**
   symbol whose setup holds. Detail: [`handoff-archive/2026-06.md`](handoff-archive/2026-06.md) → 2026-06-17.
4. **Schwab API-open RESTRICTION narrows the live universe.** 3 of 4 06-17 names were Schwab-refused for API opening
   (foreign/manual-handling). A meaningful share of the momentum scanner's small-caps are likely un-openable via the v2
   live API path — the tradeable universe is **narrower than the scanner surfaces**. #326 now auto-evicts these.
5. **Profitability-after-spread — the open validation gate (now POST-go-live).** Still needs a real kept-win sample (not
   2 events) + Schwab-tick spread-adjusted P&L. Idealized sim-fills are pipe validation, NOT a track record. Replay
   Phase 2 data clock running since 2026-06-15 (#282); needs ~a week+ of RTH ticks.
6. **Exit-fill QUALITY — Phase 2 (resting-limit brackets) is the design-first follow-up.** Phase 1 (#333, below) made the
   OMS decide tick-by-tick within ms, but a market-order-on-decision still slips on a violent spike-and-collapse. Phase 2
   = pre-stage scale/floor/stop as **broker-resident bracket orders at entry** so fills execute at exchange speed,
   independent of any OMS reaction. Design-first (lifecycle: partial fills, cancel-on-other-exit, reconciliation across
   restart). Also: **`deploy_preflight` blocks every in-window OMS deploy on the protected-CYN holding** (CYN
   `position_quantity_mismatch` critical + "1 open position" + reconciler-degraded cascade — all benign) and its 5.0s
   HTTP timeout is too tight for the 5.4s `/api/overview` — whitelist `MAI_TAI_PROTECTED_SYMBOLS` + bump the timeout.
7. **⏸️ TIMESALE capture ENABLE is PENDING (attended, next-session open).** PR #335 (`59500bc`) added additive,
   capture-only TIMESALE_EQUITY (true trades) to the v2 streamer — **MERGED + DEPLOYED with the flag OFF (inert,
   byte-identical; v2 PID 2252021→2319110, clean)**. Why pending: our `market_trade_ticks` are LEVELONE quote-snapshots
   (throttled), NOT true trades; TIMESALE was never subscribed (0 rows); Schwab has **no historical T&S endpoint** so it
   must accrue LIVE. ENABLE = set `MAI_TAI_STRATEGY_SCHWAB_1M_V2_TIMESALE_CAPTURE_ENABLED=true` + restart schwab-1m-v2 —
   but do it ATTENDED at the next open (after-hours has no v2 watchlist → can't read the SUBS/entitlement; arming
   unattended risks a flap on the shared CHART_EQUITY streamer that feeds the live ATR bot; zero capture lost — first
   real trades are next RTH). Watch `[V2-WS-SUB]` (services incl TIMESALE_EQUITY) + any `[V2-WS-RESP-ERR]
   service=TIMESALE_EQUITY` (= not entitled) + reconnect/flap; flag-disable ready. Design: `docs/timesale-capture-design.md`.
8. **Tick-confirmation entry research (parallel track, NOT deployed).** After a setup bar, enter only if upticks>downticks
   in the next ~15s. HELPS P5 (6.4:1)/P1 (8.5:1), HURTS P4-burst. P4 is NOT a loss engine (+$7.11 2-day; the real bleeder
   is **P1 MACD-cross −$14.53**); mixed (P4-base + P1/P5-tick) = +$3.41. Tonight's ticks are LEVELONE-grade (see #7);
   DECIDER = a faithful 10-day TIMESALE test ~early July ([[project-mai-tai-tick-confirmation]]). Docs in `/home/trader/`:
   tick_confirmation_findings, combined_tickconfirm_2day, p5_3path_baseline_2day, p4_tickconfirm_optionB_plan,
   intrabar-execution-design, timesale-capture-design.
8. **ORB (P6 OPEN) — fix #352 DEPLOYED, FULL validation gated to the NEXT RTH OPEN.** ORB was **silently inert since
   deploy**: the gateway `trade_tick.timestamp_ns` carries **milliseconds** for Polygon/Massive ticks but ORB read it as
   nanoseconds (`ts/1e9`) → every tick stamped **1970** → the session-anchored aggregator dropped all → **0 OR bars, 0
   trades** (heartbeat `bar_counts:{}`/`last_tick_at:{}` while the stream had live ticks). The strategy-engine already
   defends with `_normalize_tick_timestamp_ns`; ORB didn't. **PR #352 (`f404544`) MERGED + DEPLOYED 2026-06-22 10:39 ET**
   (ORB-side `_normalize_trade_ts_ns` magnitude ladder; CI green, editable-install git-pull + ORB-only restart, fleet
   untouched). **Mechanical fix VALIDATED same-session** (heartbeat `last_tick_at` now shows 2026 timestamps, bars
   complete). **⏳ REMAINING GATE — validate at 2026-06-23 09:30–09:40 ET: `bar_counts` POPULATES (or_bars fill
   09:30–09:34), an OR builds, a breakout evaluates (`[ORB-BREAKOUT]`).** **Real-money flip (qty 10, was targeted 06-22)
   stays BLOCKED until that passes.** Cloud /schedule can't reach the VPS → validate attended/VPS at the open.
   [[project-mai-tai-orb]]
9. **Extended-hours ATR order ROUTING — follow-on to #358 (2026-06-22).** The OMS fix #358 stopped the
   `SETUP_INVALID` cancellation that made v2 ATR silently RTH-only (the guard now fails open for the tape-less v2
   bot). **But the after-hours order still has to FILL:** if v2 routes a **market** order, extended hours often
   requires a **limit** order, so an un-cancelled after-hours ATR intent may still not fill. Verify the next time an
   after-hours ATR fires whether it actually fills; if not, scope extended-hours limit-order routing for v2. Also a
   deliberate-risk note: after-hours ATR = thinner/gappier real-money fills — consider whether to gate it on/off.

## ✅ CLEARED (was a go-live blocker)

- **OMS exit path is TICK-BY-TICK — FIXED (#333 `c79e8f5`, deployed live 2026-06-17 ~19:30Z).** Diagnosed off the live
  LNAI ATR-Flip trade: the +2% scale fired **~70s late at 4.345** (not ~4.45). Root cause (DB+code pinned): market-data
  had bids above +2% (4.43–4.46) for a ~14s window during the spike, but `sync_broker_state()` REST ran **inline every
  5s on the same loop that read quotes** → ticks backed up; AND the 5s staleness guard was blind because `received_at`
  was stamped at processing-time, not event-time. Fix = dedicated `_run_tick_consumer` task (market-data on its own task,
  never starved by broker-sync/intents) + last-quote-wins `_coalesce_ticks` + event-time staleness from `produced_at`.
  Behavior-identical for intents/sync/heartbeat + ladder logic; 57 passed/1 xfailed; deployed flat (only protected CYN
  held), clean (0 tracebacks). Design: [`oms-tick-consumer-design.md`](oms-tick-consumer-design.md). **Phase 2
  (resting-limit brackets) = open item #6.** True verdict still wants the next live intrabar spike on a v2 position.
- **04:00 ET watchlist-staleness race — FIXED (#324, deployed) + VERIFIED LIVE 2026-06-17.** At the 08:00 UTC / 04:00 ET
  roll: `bot day-roll fired` (08:00:00.654) → `scanner session-roll fired` (08:00:01.106) → scanner reset; v2 watchlist
  → count=0 with yesterday's 5 symbols UNSUBSCRIBED. **Zero stale symbols survived; no re-promotion race; no errors.**
- **Whole exit ladder live-proven** (2026-06-15, CUPR — scale/floor legs on simulated).
- **ATR fresh-flip qualifier MECHANISM** ✅ validated/complete (2026-06-16, live both directions).

## 🟢 LIVE OPS STATE (as of 2026-06-25)

- **2026-06-23 evening deploy (attended):** **v2 restarted → PID 2668268** (#362 EH-routing LIVE — *supersedes the v2=2319110 line below*). **ORB restarted → PID 2667440** (reclaim shadow). **⚠️ strategy-engine NOT restarted (still 2415361)** — its box disk code (main `e76d8b5`, incl. #362's byte-identical leaf import + #363) is AHEAD of runtime; the **next strategy-engine restart deploys #362/#363 — do it attended.** OMS untouched (#362 doesn't change it).
- **#366 snapshot-persist throttle (#350 piece 1) — NOT deployed:** built, flag-gated default-off; awaiting **ATTENDED close-deploy** (`snapshot_persist_throttle_secs`>0 + re-arm the #350 py-spy capture at a 16:00 ET close → confirm gaps <50s).
- **🟢 ORB = LIVE real-money → PID 2825677** (restarted 2026-06-25 14:22 ET for the Piece-1 deploy; was 2765863). Running-high mode, `live:orb`→**webull margin** (D4GUJ…), **qty 5** (CORRECTED 06-25: running-high path uses `orb_reclaim_quantity=5`, NOT `MAI_TAI_ORB_QUANTITY=10` which only applies to the inactive classic-OR path — my earlier "keep 10" note was wrong; live size is 5), 3% trail, 9:30–10:00 ET window, 1.5% gap-cap, **OMS-quote-priced entry flag ON (Piece 1, see Open Items)**. Plumbing proven green (buy→`[HARD-STOP ARMED]`→sell→`[HARD-STOP CLEARED]`→flat on real AZI fills). ⚠️ **restart-while-holding UNTESTED — don't restart OMS while ORB holds.** Dashboard shows ORB provider "alpaca" (display-only `active_broker_providers` cosmetic; routing is webull). **OMS → PID 2825688** (restarted 14:22 ET with ORB for the Piece-1 cross-process flag; flat, 0 tracebacks). *(Prior OMS PIDs: 2801063 premarket no-op; 2765200 had the 4 Webull fixes #374–#377 + #373.)*
- **⚠️ ORB heartbeat caveat (running-high mode):** `bar_counts` counts **classic-OR bars only** → stays **0 all day** in running-high mode; pre-09:25 ET state is dropped by design (the running-high observe anchor is 09:25), so **empty `bar_counts`/`last_tick_at` + "waiting for Polygon market data" placeholders premarket are EXPECTED, NOT the 1970-bug** (`_normalize_trade_ts_ns` fix confirmed in running code). The real open-time signals are **`last_tick_at`** populating + decision status `building_or`→`watching`→`entered`.
- **🟢 FCUV manual-position conflict — VERIFIED SAFE (06-25, do NOT protect).** `live:orb` (webull) holds **400 sh FCUV @ $6.87** (operator's MANUAL position; no ORB order created it) and FCUV is on ORB's watchlist. Operator trades FCUV by hand and chose to leave it **unprotected/tradeable** (`MAI_TAI_PROTECTED_SYMBOLS=CYN` only). **Code-verified the OMS will NOT touch it:** `oms_managed_positions` has a single writer gated to `schwab_1m_v2` only; ORB exits run off the OMS native hard-stop, which arms **only** on a fill from an intent ORB emitted (`_armed_hard_stops[key]` must pre-exist) — armed stops are in-memory, empty on restart, re-armed only from new bot fills. Reconciler will emit a benign position-mismatch finding for FCUV (like CYN). If ORB enters FCUV today it adds its own qty-10 managed leg; its exit sells only the managed qty, leaving the manual 400.
- **CYN 8000 sh** still held on `live:schwab_1m_v2` (protected/frozen/inert).
- **2026-06-19 Deploy Main (Juneteenth holiday override) rotated all 5 CORE PIDs** — strategy **2415361** + OMS / control /
  market-data / reconciler (all `since` ~13:29Z, NRestarts=0). **v2 UNCHANGED = 2319110 (untouched, still current).**
  polygon_30s flipped to `paper:polygon_30s` + `simulated`, `MAI_TAI_STRATEGY_PERSIST_OFFLOAD_ENABLED=true` ACTIVE. The
  offload path validates Mon premarket (closed market = no bars yet). Re-fetch any PID via `systemctl show <svc> -p MainPID --value`.
- **Service PIDs (06-17 set):** v2 **2319110** still current (#335 TIMESALE, flag OFF/inert); strategy 2299529 / OMS 2299517
  (#333) **RETIRED by the 06-19 deploy → now 2415361 etc.** *(Retired earlier: v2 2252021 [#326], OMS 2207792 / strategy 2207786 [#333], pre-go-live 2104716/2121312.)*
- **#326 — Schwab-ineligible watchlist eviction: DEPLOYED + restart-verified 2026-06-17.** v2 now evicts symbols Schwab
  refused to open today (`schwab_ineligible_today`, per-account, 60s-cached) from its watchlist, so it stops *emitting*
  for them (the OMS already blocked *re-submission*; this halts the bot at the source — parity with the old schwab_1m
  bot). Proven on the fresh boot: scanner confirmed 6, v2 watchlist = 3 (CLWT/EHGO/YMAT evicted = exactly today's
  ineligible set). ⚠️ **Known ≤60s stale-carryover window at the 04:00 roll** (cache TTL not coordinated with session
  roll) — benign (over-conservative, self-corrects, 3h pre-trade); optional hardening = key the cache on session_date.
- **Mid-session RESTART recovery (FLAT) — measured 2026-06-17:** WS re-subscribe **~4s**; `state.bars` hydrated via
  DB-seed **~2s** (Fix-b) + REST warmup **~17s** (all `warmed=3/3`); buffered streamer bars drained. **Effectively blind
  ~17s, NOT the old ~135-min blackout** — DB-seed + REST warmup backfill the strategy buffer. (Supersedes the 135-min
  worst-case in [[project-mai-tai-v2-entry-warmup-gate]] for the DB-history case.) **Note:** the snapshot `bar_counts`
  telemetry resets to live-only on restart (≠ the eval buffer `state.bars`, which is the warm one).
- **Forward-test watcher** `/tmp/atr_fwd_watch.py` → `/tmp/atr_fwd.log` (flags any live fire age≥5 as GATE-BROKEN).
- **Go-live confirm captures (VPS):** `/tmp/v2_golive_cp1.txt` (04:00 roll), `/tmp/v2_golive_cp2.txt` (7AM session),
  `/tmp/v2_golive_firstfill.txt` (first-fill watch; transient timers `v2-golive-cp{1,2}`, watch fired + exited).
- **Tick-capture retention:** prune-ticks `--keep-days 30`; first effective deletion ~2026-07-15; `market_*_ticks` only.
- **Deploy discipline:** PR + Validate mandatory (CI `validate` GREEN again — open item #2; admin-merge still available),
  direct push forbidden; attended + explicit-GO before any live-money merge/restart; restart ONLY named services + capture PIDs.

## 🗓️ RECENT ACTIVITY (newest first — full text in [`handoff-archive/2026-06.md`](handoff-archive/2026-06.md))

- **2026-06-25 (RTH, attended) — ORB day-1 results · OMS-quote-priced entry (Piece 1) shipped · v2 ATR FCUV forensics + warmup-phantom ruled out · Schwab token re-died.**
  - **ORB day 1 (qty 5, webull):** 3 entry attempts, all $0. **KUST/MIMI rejected `DAY_BUYING_POWER_INSUFFICIENT`** (transient — cash was tied in the 400 manual FCUV at 09:31; by 09:57 acct was flat w/ $2,997 cash / $11,990 day-BP / UNLIMITED day-trades, read live via `webull.data` balance). **AZI cancelled `QUOTE_DRIFT_CANCEL`** (limit at break level, ask moved 4¢ past 1¢ tol) — verified at broker: order CANCELLED, 0 filled, no position, no working order. The "401 Client not authorized" on the dashboard = the Schwab token error bleeding into the view, NOT a Webull/ORB rejection. → motivated Piece 1.
  - **🟡 Piece 1 (OMS-quote-priced ORB entry) — designed → implemented → MERGED (default-off).** PR #382 (design) + #383 (code), both merged on genuine green (validate SUCCESS; 939 unit tests). **Deploy held for a dedicated attended session** (see Open Items). Pieces 2/3 parked (Webull md not entitled).
  - **v2 ATR FCUV 12:53 forensics:** the ~7-min gap (12:46 flip → 12:53 entry) = **watchlist churn, not a defect**. FCUV was OFF v2's watchlist at 12:46 (zero probes 12:44–12:51), re-promoted 12:52:41 (db-seed 250 bars + WS-SUB), warmed 12:52:48, first live bar 12:53:02 emitted `ATR Flip B`. Entry = **Path B (unconfirmed)**, +2% scalp (~6.04→6.16, OMS closed in ~14s).
  - **Warmup phantom-flip RULED OUT** (code + data + determinism test) — see the Path-B open item: ATR state is reconstructed from the hydrated bars (not fresh-flip-by-construction); the only seed-vs-continuous mismatch (short-then-quiet >250 bars) is strictly conservative (missed BUY, never phantom). Folded "force fresh-promotion entries through hold-confirm" into the Path-B decision.
  - **Schwab token re-died ~07:38 ET** (refresh_token invalid_grant, weekly); operator re-authed, v2 self-recovered (see Open Items).
- **2026-06-25 (premarket, attended) — ORB real-money DAY 1 pre-open validation + OMS no-op restart (operator GO).** Bot already running (PID 2765863, day-rolled to 06-25). **Wiring ground-truthed from `/proc`:** `MAI_TAI_ORB_BROKER_PROVIDER=webull`, `live:orb`, enabled, qty **10** (NOT the doc's qty 5 — operator confirmed keep 10), reclaim OFF / running-high ON; last night's AZI test = real Webull order IDs round-tripped, ORB **flat**. **Data-flow watch (5 min, 05:46–05:51 ET):** gateway delivered **FCUV 3,232 + AZI 3,013 trade-ticks** (~10/sec/symbol) — feed healthy; confirmed via `mai_tai:market-data` stream. **"Label mismatch" explained** (running-high mode: `bar_counts`=OR-mode-only→0 all day; pre-09:25 state dropped by design; empty premarket ≠ 1970-bug; 1970-fix present). **🟢 FCUV conflict found + verified SAFE:** `live:orb` holds 400 manual FCUV @ 6.87; code-verified the OMS won't manage non-OMS positions → left unprotected/tradeable per operator (details in Live Ops State). **OMS restarted (flat, premarket) → PID 2801063**, clean/0 tracebacks; functionally byte-identical (only docs #378–#380 ahead of disk). **⏳ NEXT GATE = 09:25–09:30 ET:** `last_tick_at` populates, decisions `building_or`→`watching`, first real-money breakout/`[HARD-STOP ARMED]`. [[project_mai_tai_webull_fill_arm_verified]] · [[project_mai_tai_orb]]

- **2026-06-24 (late) — V2 ATR deep validation (read-only; box-verified, no deploys).** (1) **Live P&L**: V2 lifecycle works on the real acct but is ~breakeven-negative — **−$4.89 / 3 days, ~32% win**, death-by-spread on low-priced movers; 06-23/24 zero fills (Schwab API-open-restricted names AZI/CUPR rejected). (2) **FRTT "why no trade"**: dropped by the operator's **change%<30 scanner-fade rule** (`prune_faded_candidates`, `confirmed_fade_remove_below_change_pct=30`; commits `51a4ad0` 06-10 + `41fbbe6`/#277 06-11 remove-from-bot) — proven by `[CONFIRMED] removed ... FRTT` logs at 11:14/11:51/12:05 ET. (3) **ATR entry is BAR-CLOSE not intrabar** — variant B uses the bar's intrabar high but emits at bar close (CUPR: 11:02 flip → order 11:03:04). (4) **Hold-confirm Path-A vs Path-B**: hold-confirm IS live/enabled (N=20s/5bps), but **83% of entries leak via the unconfirmed bar-close Path-B fallback, which is net-negative** → bar-close fallback undoes the edge (see Open Items decision). Corrected two earlier mis-reads (feed_retention≠FRTT cause; "bar-close-only/on_quote=None" was the flag-OFF doc behavior). [[project_mai_tai_v2_atr_validation]]

- **2026-06-24 night — 🟢 ORB WEBULL GO-LIVE: qty-1 plumbing test PASSED + ORB started (real money). Caught & fixed 4 go-live blockers.** Ran a qty-1 AZI live plumbing test (`intent→OMS→Webull` on `live:orb`, margin acct, after-hours) — which surfaced **4 real bugs**, each deployed (admin-merge, CI-red, ff + OMS-restart) the same night:
  - **#374** — ORB emits 4-decimal limit prices; Webull rejects (`417, min step 0.01` for px>$1) → **every ORB order on a >$1 stock would reject**. Fix: `WebullBrokerAdapter._round_to_tick`.
  - **#375** — OMS only polled orders with a `broker_order_id`; Webull returns only `client_order_id` at submit → **Webull fills never detected → stop never armed (NAKED position)**. Fix: poll by either id.
  - **#376** — `None` broker_order_id in sync metadata crashed the broker-sync loop (`OrderEventPayload` validation) every cycle → fill never persisted. Fix: `or ""`.
  - **#377** — OMS entrypoint never called `configure_logging` → ran at WARNING → **all INFO silently dropped** (incl. `[HARD-STOP ARMED]`). Fix: configure INFO logging. (+**#373** added the `[HARD-STOP ARMED/TRIGGERED/CLEARED]` log lines — the in-memory `_armed_hard_stops` had no API/native-order/log; ORB uses the in-memory trail, no `native_stop_guard`.)
  - **VERIFIED GREEN** (real Webull fills): BUY→FILLED qty1@1.7293→position recognized→`[HARD-STOP ARMED] entry=1.7293 stop=1.6774 trail=3%`; SELL→`[HARD-STOP CLEARED]`→FLAT. Bonus: stale below-market buy auto-cancelled by the Tier-1 quote-drift guard. Account clean, OMS stable (0 sync errors).
  - **ORB STARTED** (operator GO): `project-mai-tai-orb.service` active (PID 2765863, 18:00 ET), running-high mode, `live:orb`→webull margin (D4GUJ…), qty 5, 3% trail, 9:30–10:00 ET window, 1.5% gap-cap. Seeds 9:25 ET, **first real entry 9:30–10:00 ET 2026-06-25**. ⚠️ **restart-while-holding still untested — don't restart OMS while ORB holds.** Dashboard shows ORB provider "alpaca" (known display-only `active_broker_providers` cosmetic; routing is webull). [[project_mai_tai_webull_fill_arm_verified]]
- **2026-06-23/24 — Heavy day: v2 EH-routing LIVE · ORB reclaim SHADOW-deployed · #350 root-caused + throttled · Webull real-account integration (2FA-blocked).**
  - **🟢 #362 — v2 extended-hours routing FIX: MERGED + LIVE on v2 (06-23 ~16:00 ET, attended; v2 PID 2668268).** Evidence-pinned root cause: every v2 order hit Schwab as `session=NORMAL`/`orderType=MARKET` → can't fill outside 9:30–16:00; the EXIT/stop-guard path stamped `session=AM/PM`+limit but the ENTRY path never ported the legacy `order_routing_metadata`. Fix = extract `strategy_core/order_routing.py` leaf (byte-identical for legacy), v2 opens now call it (limit@ask + session) in extended hours; RTH unchanged (`session is None → {}`). Mirrors the proven macd_30s/schwab_1m path. ⚠️ **v2 now places REAL PM/aftermarket limit orders.**
  - **🟢 ORB reclaim entry (PR #363) — SHADOW-deployed** (`orb_intrabar_reclaim_enabled=true`; ORB PID 2667440). Cap-off + reclaim-of-OR_high (25s hold) → resting LIMIT@OR_high + 3% trail + qty 5; flag-gated (off = byte-identical bar-close/8%/12%-cap; full ORB suite green). Routes `paper:orb`→alpaca (no creds) → **rejects = shadow** (signals generate, nothing posts, like polygon). Fill-instrumentation stamps intended OR_high + emit_ms; `scripts/orb_fill_slippage.py` reads slippage from `fills`. Real posting pending Webull. [[project-mai-tai-orb]]
  - **ORB design saga (read-only):** HSCS 06-23 **+40% move MISSED — the 12% OR-width cap screened it by 0.30pp** (12.30% vs 12.0%); breakout never evaluated. 7-day Polygon-1s backtest (look-ahead-free pre-09:25 universe): **−1.5% HARD stop = degenerate** (HSCS round-trips to −1.5%); **reclaim entry + TRAILING 3/5/8% ≈ +170–184% net/week** (idealized OR_high fill → magnitude optimistic, direction robust). **Regime-classifier Stage-1 FAILED** — premarket-retention does NOT predict the winning trail (classifier ≈ fixed-5%, captured +1 of +149 oracle headroom) → **default a fixed trail** (3% best/most-consistent on the week); do NOT build the switch.
  - **🟠 Webull real-money ORB account — integration STARTED, 2FA-BLOCKED (PR #364 = design + sandbox probe; real adapter NOT built).** Verified: existing `webull.py` is a stub that can't post; Webull **OpenAPI is live** (SDK `webull-openapi-python-sdk` 2.0.11, HMAC app-key/secret, host `us-oauth-open-api.webull.com`, **requires instrument_id**, sync client → wrap in `to_thread`). Operator set Trading perm + IP whitelist `104.236.43.107/32`; **"Enable 2FA Verification" ON → 403 "Resource not authorized"** (each token needs a one-time Webull-mobile-app approval = re-auth SPOF for a headless bot). **NEXT (operator, portal change rate-limited to ~next day): flip 2FA OFF → I re-probe (read-only) → build the real adapter from the response shapes → wire `live:orb`→webull → attended go-live.** Creds are in the box env only (never chat/code/commits).
  - **🔴 #350 close-freeze ROOT-CAUSED (py-spy) + throttle built.** 185k-sample close capture: **~72% CPU in JSON `iterencode`(52%)+`raw_decode`(20%) on the event loop** — the dashboard/scanner snapshot (`scanner_alert_engine_state` carrying `today_alerts[-5000:]`) re-encoded+committed **per Redis message** via `_publish_strategy_state_snapshot → _persist_scanner_snapshots → _replace_dashboard_snapshot` (the `json.loads(json.dumps(…, default=str))` sanitize = encode+decode, then psycopg re-encodes on commit = **2 encodes + 1 decode**). #350's existing offload covers BAR persistence, **not** this path. **Design = PR #365** (priority: throttle → offload → encode-once). **Piece #1 (throttle) = PR #366** (`snapshot_persist_throttle_secs`, default 0 = off = byte-identical; trailing-edge debounce, force-flush on shutdown/day-roll; 243-test regression green). **Pending ATTENDED close-deploy** (enable + re-arm the #350 capture, confirm gaps <50s) → then decide #2/#3. [[project-mai-tai-polygon-freeze]]
  - **market_capture VALIDATED (read-only):** `market_capture_trades` are genuine Polygon prints (multi-venue, trade conditions, odd lots, sub-penny — NOT quote snapshots), ns timestamps clean, backfill retrievable → **backtest-ready; reroute the decider off `market_trade_ticks` onto `market_capture_trades`.** [[project-mai-tai-market-capture]]
- **2026-06-22 (Mon EOD) — Polygon data-capture infra SHIPPED · #350 close-verdict CPU-bound · OMS after-hours-ATR fix · ATR oracle landed.**
  - **🟢 Central Polygon tick/bar capture — MERGED + DURABLE.** #354 (`market_capture_app` service, Restart=always — raw Polygon trades+quotes from the gateway stream, ms→ns normalized) + #355 (`/v3/trades` historical backfill) + #356 (daily 21:00Z post-close gather of the FULL scanner-qualified universe: trades+quotes+**1-min bars** via Massive REST → `market_capture_bars`). 14-day prune covers all 3 tables. **Chose REST-gather over widening the live stream — deliberately, to NOT burden the #350 CPU-bound strategy-engine** (all consumers drain the shared stream). No-stored-raw-ticks gap closed; Massive REST entitlement CONFIRMED (trades/quotes/1-min-aggs). [[project-mai-tai-market-capture]]
  - **🔴 #350 freeze VALIDATION (both windows) = NOT a full fix, it's CPU-BOUND.** Open 63s gap (09:43 ET) + close **76s gap (16:02 ET)**, CPU pegged **~100% user-space, %wait≈0** during both. The DB-offload IS active + removed the I/O-wait stall, but the loop still saturates one core ~60-76s at peak windows. **PIVOT (armed tomorrow): py-spy the indicator-recompute hotspot.** [[project-mai-tai-polygon-freeze]]
  - **🟡 OMS fix #358 (`f427434`) DEPLOYED — v2 ATR after-hours UNBLOCKED.** Root cause: the Tier-3 setup-revalidation guard (`_intent_setup_invalid_reason`, PR #178) abandoned every v2 ATR-Flip intent that didn't fill instantly, because the isolated v2 bot writes NO decision tape (all v2 bars `decision_status=''` → always `idle != signal` → `SETUP_INVALID`). RTH fills in ~2s before the guard; after-4PM thin liquidity → guard cancels → **ATR was silently RTH-only** (3 good after-4PM setups cancelled today). Fix = **fail-open when the bar has no decision_status** (momentum bots unaffected; 44/44 OMS tests + 2 regression green; OMS-only restart, flat-confirmed). **⚠️ BEHAVIOR CHANGE: v2 ATR now fills after-hours (real money) — see OPEN #9.**
  - **ATR oracle landed (#357)** — `analysis/atr_flip.py::compute_atr_trail` (the reference the live v2 `_update_atr_state` is pinned to) was off-main; landed code-only + import test. Determinism test still passes (live v2 == oracle, no drift).
  - **Read-only research:** TIMESALE_EQUITY is a **dead Schwab service** (not an entitlement — Schwab has no equity T&S; flag rolled back) → true T&S = Polygon. **Intrabar-ALONE = WASH** on today's 8 ATR trades (bot already books the trail touch-price). **Hold-confirmation = nets POSITIVE** (real-tick replay: best net_hold/10s skips 3/5 false-flip losers, keeps winners, +$0.75) — **promising NOT proven** (1 loser-heavy day). Intrabar is the plumbing hold-confirmation needs (build together, design-first, default-off, more days). [[project-mai-tai-tick-confirmation]]
  - **🔜 ARMED for tomorrow 2026-06-23 09:30 ET open (autonomous VPS capture PID 2603075):** (1) **ORB full validation** (OR builds? breakout evaluates? → unblocks the real-money flip) + (2) **#350 CPU profiling** (py-spy). Reported separately ~09:53 ET.
- **2026-06-22 (Mon) — ORB fix shipped · #350 freeze verdict = CPU-bound · TIMESALE = dead Schwab service.**
  (1) **ORB** found silently inert (1970-timestamp bug) → **#352 merged + deployed + mechanically validated** (see OPEN
  ITEM #8); full OR/breakout validation = tomorrow's open; real-money flip stays blocked. (2) **#350 freeze fix —
  OPEN-window verdict = NOT fully fixed, it's CPU-BOUND.** The DB-offload is ACTIVE and removed the I/O-wait stall, but a
  **63s snapshot-batch gap recurred 09:43 ET with CPU pegged ~100% USER-space (`%wait≈0`)** → remaining freeze is
  CPU-bound (likely synchronous indicator recompute on the loop), NOT DB-I/O. **PIVOT = profile the strategy-engine CPU
  hotspot at peak-volume windows** (py-spy on indicator recompute). Close-window confirmation pending ~16:12 ET. (3)
  **TIMESALE capture** enabled 08:47 ET → **Schwab REJECTED (code-11)**. Disambiguated via `GET /trader/v1/userPreference`
  (we HOLD the NP + level2 Market-Data bundle → **not an entitlement wall**) + the schwab-py service catalog (**Schwab's
  streamer defines NO TIMESALE service** — equity streams are only CHART_EQUITY/LEVELONE_EQUITIES/NYSE_BOOK/NASDAQ_BOOK/
  SCREENER_EQUITY; TIMESALE_EQUITY is a legacy TDA name dropped in the migration). **Schwab cannot provide equity
  time-&-sales at all** — not renameable, not requestable. Flag left ON (benign/inert, operator choice; not a bug — do
  NOT re-flag the code-11). **Consequence: the July tick-confirm decider must source true trades from Polygon/Massive,
  NOT Schwab.** [[project-mai-tai-orb]] · [[project-mai-tai-tick-confirmation]]
- **2026-06-19 (Juneteenth, market closed) — POLYGON 30s: freeze root-caused + 3 fixes DEPLOYED, freeze fix ACTIVE.**
  Read-only diagnosis (PROVEN): the **strategy-engine asyncio event loop freezes 50–345s at peak-volume windows** (RTH
  open + 4pm close), process-wide, localized to strategy-engine (stalled bars carried real volume → feed fine; **v2/ATR
  are a SEPARATE service, not this loop**). Root cause = **synchronous bar persistence (`_persist_bar_history` /
  `_persist_revised_closed_bar`) doing SELECT+commit on the event loop** inside the ≤5000-event drain (revise path scales
  with tick volume). Proof: snapshot-batch cadence stopped 96s then 53s on 06-16 19:56–20:03, bars drained in catch-up
  bursts (CRVO 345s lag). Data integrity CLEAN (OHLCV 0 corrupt across 643k rows/39d; stalls = lateness NOT loss; ~4.5%
  synthetic zero-vol bars = backtest caveat). Dashboard "Persist lag" was a MISLABEL (it's bar AGE = now−latest_bar, not
  write-lag → off-hours always elevated/red). **Three held PRs built, diff-reviewed, merged (non-admin squash) +
  DEPLOYED Sunday-eve via Deploy Main** (holiday override `allow_live_restart=true` — the calendar guard false-blocks on
  Juneteenth; verified FLAT first: 0 virtual positions / 0 working orders / only protected CYN):
  - **#348** display-only relabel `Persist lag → Bar age` (chip `lag elevated → bars stale`).
  - **#349** polygon_30s default → `paper:polygon_30s` + `simulated` (was live:/webull, uncredentialed → shadow-reject
    footgun; 06-18 = 262 intents ALL rejected / 0 fills). Routes to SimulatedBrokerAdapter (fills in sim). VPS env flipped
    + 2 stale default-pinning tests updated. **Note: `shadow` is a display label, does NOT gate execution.**
  - **#350** flag-gated **batched persist offload** (the freeze fix): persists capture-at-call → buffer → flushed off-loop
    via `asyncio.to_thread` BEFORE intents publish (+ iteration safety-net + shutdown). **Default OFF = byte-identical**;
    8 new + 217 service tests green; full correctness audit in the PR (one ordered session + flush-before-publish =
    read-after-write safe; per-item commit/rollback isolates failures; persist-path only).
  - **Env now:** `paper:polygon_30s` · `simulated` · `MAI_TAI_STRATEGY_PERSIST_OFFLOAD_ENABLED=true` (ACTIVE, confirmed
    via settings-load). 5 core services restarted (NRestarts=0, 0 errors, heartbeat advancing); v2/orb untouched;
    dashboard = "Bar age" + shadow/simulated.
  - **⚠️ Offload path NOT yet exercised with live bars** (market closed until Mon ~4am ET premarket). **Monday watch (no
    restart):** at 09:30 open + 4pm close run `pidstat -p <strategy_pid> 1` + time the drain. Worked → no 50–345s snapshot
    gap, CPU idle-during-DB. Still freezes → CPU-pegged = CPU-bound (#2) not DB-I/O (#1) → pivot. Memory [[project-mai-tai-polygon-freeze]].
  - **Server cleanup INVENTORY (read-only, nothing deleted):** NO logrotate on `/var/log/project-mai-tai/*.log` (1.4GB
    unbounded); DB 3.6GB — `reconciliation_findings` 1GB/2.4M rows + `strategy_bar_history` 1.7GB UNBOUNDED (only tick
    tables pruned @30d); schwab_ticks JSONL 1.3GB static (stopped 06-08). Disk 14% fine; **4GB RAM is the constraint**
    (ties to freeze DB contention). Retention strategy proposed, awaiting operator approval.

- **2026-06-18 (late) — ORB (P6 "OPEN") BUILT + DEPLOYED PAPER.** Deployed after-close (Juneteenth+weekend → validate
  over the weekend; **real-money flip = separate later gate**, Mon 2026-06-22 qty 10 target). On `main`: **#344**
  (consolidated stack 3a service + 3b entry + 3c heartbeat), **#340** (OMS bid-only TRAIL-8% ratchet, inert at
  trail_pct=0), **#345** (dashboard render allowlists + paper-aware PAPER/LIVE pill), **#346** (register `orb` in
  `runtime_registry`, gated, isolated). `project-mai-tai-orb.service` **active+enabled, NRestarts=0**, heartbeat
  publishing, `account_name=paper:orb`. **Verified rendering** (control-plane :8100): `/api/bots` lists `orb`; compact
  dashboard shows the ORB card with a **PAPER badge**; `/bot/orb` detail page = HTTP 200. Architecture: isolated bot
  (own process like v2) consuming the EXISTING market-data gateway (Polygon/Massive trades, NOT Schwab); universe =
  premarket two-squeeze `momentum_confirmed` (no seed hookup). **Dashboard-render lesson:** a 3c heartbeat is NOT enough —
  `_build_bot_views` builds `data["bots"]` from `configured_strategy_registrations`, not the stream, so a card needs
  THREE layers (registration + render allowlists + paper pill). **Caveats:** each `Deploy Main` showed red "failure" =
  benign reconciler/CYN health-gate (services all healthy, code landed); new systemd unit isn't in `install_units`
  allowlist (installed by hand once); `--delete-branch` on stacked #339 closed the dependent #341 → recovered via a
  consolidated local merge (#344). **OPEN:** the `confirmed_at` pre-09:25 universe mapping is the #1 Monday watch
  (eyeball the armed heartbeat watchlist pre-open — safe-fails to sit-out); restart-while-holding UNTESTED (shares v2's
  open item #1); kill-switch = bot-kill keeps OMS TRAIL-8% but OMS-restart drops the native stop → flatten manually.

  width<12% · cutoff 10:30 · one/symbol); **EXIT = TRAIL-8%** (ratchets from HWM). **Data:** stored
  `schwab_1m_v2` bars are watchlist-gated (winners promoted post-breakout) → must source from **Schwab REST
  pricehistory** (validated vs Pine); live prereq = scanner surfaces candidates pre-09:30. **EXIT study
  (25 days, 159 entries, RGNT-06-15 out):** TRAIL-8% the **only** exit with positive median capture (+0.22)
  + highest win 55%; **TRAIL-3% overfit** (7d 0.41 → 25d −0.20); COMBO/multi-layer/EMA all lose. **ENTRY
  study:** a 09:25/7-min/frozen-high sharpening **failed to beat PRIOR** — structure worse net expectancy
  (avg 2.5 vs 3.4), **VWAP/EMA filter INERT** on it (rejected 1 of 492 → precision gap is structural not
  the filter), **volume sweep no sweet spot**, and **without INHD(+314%)/QUCY(+82%) the new structure
  collapses 2.5→1.7 while PRIOR is robust 3.4→3.1.** **Honest framing:** ORB is a **thin-edge,
  runner-dependent** strategy (best ~3.4%/take, 55% win, +0.22 median capture; profit in the tail) —
  **leading candidate for live, NOT a verdict.** **Gap-through caveat kept:** TRAIL-8% is a hard intrabar
  stop, modeled fills optimistic on thin books. **Next:** scope intrabar-on-LEVELONE for ORB (per-path
  isolation + ORB policy + gap-through frequency), then forward-validation, then small attended go-live.
  (PR #337 = the 7-day writeup + engine; this entry supersedes it with the settled conclusion.)
- **2026-06-17 (late) — TIMESALE capture (#335) + tick-confirmation research day.** Audit found our trade ticks are
  LEVELONE quote-snapshots not true trades (Schwab has no historical T&S). Built additive capture-only TIMESALE_EQUITY
  (#335, merged + deployed flag-OFF/inert); **enable pending attended next-open (open item #7).** Also de-flaked 2
  time-dependent strategy-engine data-halt tests (trading-hours gate vs CI-run-time → frozen clock) to keep CI real-green.
  Research (NOT deployed): tick-confirmation per-path (P5/P1 help, P4 doesn't; P4 not a loss engine, P1 the bleeder;
  mixed +$3.41), ATR intrabar false-flip cost ≈ cancels benefit, intrabar-execution + timesale design docs. Open item #8 +
  [[project-mai-tai-tick-confirmation]]; docs in `/home/trader/*.md`.
- **2026-06-17 — OMS tick-by-tick exit consumer (#333) diagnosed → built → CI-green → DEPLOYED live.** From the live LNAI
  scale that filled ~70s late at 4.345: root-caused to quote-consumption lag (broker-sync REST inline-blocking the
  shared read loop) + processing-time staleness stamping; fixed with a dedicated `_run_tick_consumer` task +
  last-quote-wins coalescing + event-time staleness. Attended deploy (v2 flat, only protected CYN), OMS+strategy restart
  only, clean. Also confirmed CI `validate` is green again (open item #2 cleared). Phase 2 (resting brackets) = open #6.
- **2026-06-17 — #326 (Schwab-ineligible eviction) built → reviewed → DEPLOYED → restart-verified.** Ported the old
  schwab_1m bot's watchlist eviction into the isolated v2 bot (`_schwab_ineligible_symbols`, 60s cache, OmsStore loader,
  session_date parity with the OMS write-side). Merged `fe76f06`; v2 restarted; eviction proven on fresh boot.
- **2026-06-17 — Mid-session restart recovery profiled (FLAT):** ~17s blind, comes back with scanner-set-minus-ineligible.
  **restart-while-HOLDING still untested (open item #1).**
- **2026-06-17 — v2 GO-LIVE deployed (attended, reasoned risk).** PR #325 merged (`cbd1a09`); env set (ATR-only +
  go-live + `live:schwab_1m_v2` + schwab); strategy/OMS/v2 restarted clean; all gates verified. **Morning verdict:**
  04:00 roll/race-fix ✅; isolation ✅ (zero P1/P2, zero CYN); **4 ATR orders all $0** (3 Schwab-REJECTED foreign-restricted,
  1 LNAI accepted-then-our-cancel) → first real fill pending (open item #3); Schwab API-open restriction finding (open #4).
- **2026-06-16 — Go-live workstreams scoped; ATR qualifier MECHANISM validated; secondary qualifier rejected; age-gate
  validated; 04:00 race diagnosed; handoff restructured.** (Full detail in the archive.)
- **2026-06-15 — ATR qualifier built+enabled (#320); tick-capture activated (#282); warmup early-fire + DB-seed fixes
  live-proven; v2 OMS exits activated.**
