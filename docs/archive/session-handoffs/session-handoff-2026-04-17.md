# Session Handoff - 2026-04-17

## What Changed

This handoff captures the TradingView automation and webhook work completed on
`2026-04-17`, including:

- Schwab/webhook cutover onto the VPS
- TradingView alert automation build-out and VPS session bootstrap
- cleanup and verification of stale TradingView alerts
- sticky intraday TradingView alert behavior
- current live status and next to-do items

## Webhook / Schwab Status

The VPS webhook path is live and working:

- public webhook host:
  - `https://hook.project-mai-tai.live/webhook`
- Schwab OAuth callback:
  - `https://hook.project-mai-tai.live/auth/callback`
- Schwab auth/token persistence is working on the VPS
- off-hours order construction was corrected to use fresh Schwab quote data
  instead of the old signal-price buffer path

Current operational split:

- scanner / Mai Tai runtime on VPS
- TradingView alert automation on VPS
- webhook execution + Schwab execution on VPS

## TradingView Automation Build-Out

The following pieces were added and verified in this repo:

- TradingView alert sidecar service
  - [tradingview_alerts_app.py](C:/Users/kkvkr/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/project-mai-tai/src/project_mai_tai/services/tradingview_alerts_app.py)
- Playwright TradingView operator
  - [tradingview_playwright.py](C:/Users/kkvkr/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/project-mai-tai/src/project_mai_tai/services/tradingview_playwright.py)
- session export / probe scripts
  - [tradingview_export_session.py](C:/Users/kkvkr/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/project-mai-tai/scripts/tradingview_export_session.py)
  - [tradingview_probe_session.py](C:/Users/kkvkr/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/project-mai-tai/scripts/tradingview_probe_session.py)
- manual TradingView alert list/delete helper
  - [tradingview_manage_alerts.py](C:/Users/kkvkr/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/project-mai-tai/scripts/tradingview_manage_alerts.py)
- session refresh runbook
  - [tradingview-vps-session-refresh-runbook-2026-04-17.md](C:/Users/kkvkr/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/project-mai-tai/docs/tradingview-vps-session-refresh-runbook-2026-04-17.md)
  - [TradingView-VPS-Session-Refresh-Runbook-2026-04-17.docx](C:/Users/kkvkr/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/project-mai-tai/docs/TradingView-VPS-Session-Refresh-Runbook-2026-04-17.docx)

## Critical VPS TradingView Result

Direct VPS TradingView sign-in was blocked by TradingView rate limiting on the
login endpoint, but the session-bootstrap path now works:

1. export a live TradingView session from local Windows Chrome
2. inject that session into a fresh Linux Chrome profile on the VPS
3. run TradingView automation on the VPS without hitting the VPS login flow

Important result:

- VPS TradingView auth/session bootstrap is viable
- VPS alert create/delete is working
- current active service mode is:
  - `provider=playwright`
  - `auto_sync_enabled=true`

## Alert Cleanup / Verification

Multiple stale TradingView alerts were discovered during bring-up. The initial
cleanup checks were flawed because the TradingView `Log` tab was read instead of
the real `Alerts` tab. That was corrected.

Real stale alert cleanup was later verified against the actual TradingView
Alerts panel.

After final cleanup and later state corrections:

- stale symbols such as `AAPL`, `TSLA`, `NFLX`, `BFRG`, `KIDZ`, and stale
  `MYSE` were removed from the real TradingView account
- current managed alert state was brought back to:
  - `ELAB` only

## Delete-Path Bug Found And Fixed

One important bug was found in the TradingView remove flow:

- the service could treat a symbol as removed based on internal state even when
  the real TradingView alert still existed

This was fixed by tightening the remove path in
[tradingview_playwright.py](C:/Users/kkvkr/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/project-mai-tai/src/project_mai_tai/services/tradingview_playwright.py):

- after a remove attempt, the operator now re-checks the actual TradingView
  alert list
- it only treats the delete as successful if the alert is truly absent

Regression coverage was added in:

- [test_tradingview_alert_service.py](C:/Users/kkvkr/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/project-mai-tai/tests/unit/test_tradingview_alert_service.py)

## Sticky Intraday Alert Behavior

The TradingView alert policy changed during this session.

Old behavior:

- scanner confirm -> create alert
- live path drop -> remove alert immediately

New behavior:

- scanner confirm -> create alert
- intraday live path drop -> keep the alert for the current scanner session
- old-session leftovers can still roll off after session change

Reason for the change:

- reduce orphan/mismatch risk
- avoid missing same-session re-entries after a stock re-accelerates
- let the TradingView/Pine side filter poor setups instead of aggressively
  removing the alert immediately

Important note:

- the sticky behavior was deployed
- one manual cleanup pass was needed after deploy to remove the pre-existing
  stale `MYSE` from the sticky set baseline
- the live state now reflects the intended baseline correctly

## Current Live State

At the end of this session, the VPS `tradingview-alerts` health showed:

- `provider = playwright`
- `auto_sync_enabled = true`
- `auth_required = false`
- `last_error = null`
- `managed_symbols = ["ELAB"]`
- `desired_symbols = ["ELAB"]`
- `requested_symbols = ["ELAB"]`

The control plane is up again and `project-mai-tai.live` is reachable behind
basic auth.

Important dashboard interpretation from this session:

- historical fills/data were not lost
- empty live panels earlier in the day were due to empty current runtime state,
  not a database wipe

## ELAB Scanner Read

Key ELAB timeline captured during this session:

- `07:31:05 AM ET`
  - `VOLUME_SPIKE`
  - `SQUEEZE_5MIN`
  - `SQUEEZE_10MIN`
- `07:32 AM ET`
  - news article present, but not qualifying `Path A` news
- `07:36:05 AM ET`
  - scanner confirmation:
    - `confirmation_path = PATH_B_2SQ`

Interpretation:

- ELAB was confirmed because of the Path B squeeze/volume behavior
- news existed, but it was not the reason ELAB was promoted
- Path A news eligibility was false for that event

## Operational Notes

1. Local helper Chrome/session
   - the earlier local helper/browser process used during bring-up was shut down
   - the active TradingView automation path is now the VPS headless service

2. Re-login detection
   - relogin detection logic exists
   - notification delivery is still not configured
   - current practical check is the VPS `tv-alerts` health endpoint

3. Existing control-plane visibility
   - `tradingview-alerts` appears in the service strip and Service Health table
   - there is not yet a dedicated TradingView-specific dashboard tile

## To-Do / Next Items

1. Confirmation / rank timing
   - review whether the current promotion threshold is too slow
   - specifically examine whether waiting for higher rank (for example `70`)
     causes late live-path promotion

2. News relaxation
   - revisit Path A / news strictness
   - consider allowing stronger scanner names through with softer news handling
     when score is already strong enough

3. TradingView bot UI
   - build a dedicated TradingView operations screen showing:
     - managed alerts
     - requested/protected symbols
     - sync plan
     - session/auth state
     - log/activity history

4. Pre-market health check
   - add a `6:00 AM ET` readiness check for TradingView automation / service
     health

5. End-of-day cleanup
   - after-hours reset rule requested:
     - `6:01 PM ET` -> delete all session-created TradingView alerts

6. Momentum alert catch-up logic
   - review and tune the new late catch-up spike path if needed
   - goal: do not miss obvious current-state moves just because the earlier
     internal spike seed was missed

7. Historical scanner overlap analysis
   - historical `five_pillars` / `top_gainers` membership at exact confirmation
     time was not reconstructable from the old persistence model
   - fix deployed:
     - strategy engine now appends `scanner_cycle_history` snapshots to
       `dashboard_snapshots`
     - each row stores reduced per-cycle scanner state:
       - `watchlist`
       - `all_confirmed`
       - `top_confirmed`
       - `five_pillars`
       - `top_gainers`
       - ticker-only helper arrays for overlap checks
     - rows are appended only when scanner state meaningfully changes
     - retention is capped by `MAI_TAI_DASHBOARD_SCANNER_HISTORY_RETENTION`
       (default `5000`)
   - VPS verification after deploy:
     - `scanner_cycle_history` rows are now being written successfully

## EFOI Bug Fix

Issue observed:

- `EFOI` appeared in broad scanners (`top_gainers`, `five_pillars`) but never
  entered the raw momentum-alert sequence
- user highlighted a clear `09:15 - 09:20 AM ET` move with large volume and
  strong price expansion that should still have been capturable

Diagnosis:

- this was not downtime
- this was not a low-volume filter issue
- the real gap was in the momentum alert chain:
  - `VOLUME_SPIKE` must be emitted first
  - only then do `SQUEEZE_5MIN` / `SQUEEZE_10MIN` alerts open up
- if the internal spike seed is missed, later obvious squeezes can be ignored

Fix deployed:

- `momentum_alerts.py` now supports a late catch-up seed path
- if the engine sees an obvious current spike + squeeze combination after the
  earlier seed was missed, it can backfill `VOLUME_SPIKE` and allow squeeze
  alerts in the same cycle
- a regression test was added for this path

Validation:

- `tests/unit/test_strategy_core.py` -> `15 passed`
- strategy service was restarted on VPS
- `project-mai-tai-strategy.service` returned healthy/active after deploy

## If Picking Up Later

The most important current mental model is:

- the VPS TradingView session is now bootstrapped from a valid exported local
  session
- intraday alerts are intentionally sticky
- stale real-alert removal was a real bug and has been fixed
- the current expected live baseline is:
  - only real confirmed/session-kept symbols should remain
  - current example at handoff: `ELAB`
